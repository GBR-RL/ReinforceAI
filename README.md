# About Me

Hey there! I'm Rohiith,a Machine Learning Engineer with a serious passion for Reinforcement Learning. Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of Robotics as I pursue my Master's degree!ðŸ¤“ðŸ“š. My mission? To train AI agents that can beat the toughest games and maybe even make a mean cup of coffee. â˜•ðŸ¤–

## My Passion

Obsessed with cracking the code on Reinforcement Learning! I get my kicks from teaching machines to learn, adapt, and maybe surprise me with their brilliance. If there's a new algorithm, you bet I'm trying it out before my morning coffee.

## My Journey

From tinkering with code in my garage to crafting complex AI systems, my journey has been anything but boring. Iâ€™ve tackled bugs, celebrated tiny wins, and learned that even AI needs a break. Always on the lookout for the next big thing in machine learning.

## My Vision

âœ¨ Dreaming big about a future where AI does the heavy lifting and we get to focus on the fun stuff. My goal? To make Reinforcement Learning accessible, exciting, and maybe a tad less intimidating for everyone. Plus, who wouldnâ€™t want a robot sidekick?

## Let's Connect

ðŸ’¡ Got a cool project, a wild idea, or just want to chat about AI (or why pineapple on pizza is awesome)? Hit me up on [GitHub](https://github.com/GBR-RL) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohiithgb/). Letâ€™s make some machine learning magic happen! ðŸš€ðŸ’¬
